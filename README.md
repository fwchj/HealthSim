# HealthSim
Agent-based model of the health care systems - written in Java/Repast. 

This is the public repository for the agent-based model *HealthSim* developped at the Simulation Unit of the National Laboratory of Public Policy in Mexico City. *HealthSim* is a flexible multi-purpose agent-based model of the healthcare system. It is built around a number of core processes that are likely to matter in all health stystem. Furthermore, it is built with flexibility in mind, allowing interested researchers to adapt the model relatively easily to different contexts through parameters and input data. 


In this repository you will find the **full source code**, research articles and the Overview, Design concepts and Details (ODD) protocol of the model. 

## Available documents

### Research articles
We have currently two reseach articles online: 

- [Using *HealthSim* for ex-ante public policy analysis - the case of a Swiss policy reform](Articles/HealthSim_Swiss_Deductible.pdf). In this study we illustrate how *HealthSim* can be adapted to a specific context by adapting the parameter set and more importantly by importing country specific data. We analyse a recently proposed policy change of increasing the minimum deductible level in the Swiss Health Insurance market. 

- [*HealthSim:*  a  flexible  general  purpose  agent-based  model  of health  care  systems]((Articles/HealthSim_ModelPresentation.pdf)). This article introduces the main concepts of *HealthSim* and presents a number of illustrative examples. For the illustrative examples we focus on the question of mandatory health insurance and to what extent premiums should be set by age-groups. 


### Technical documents 
- [HealthSim - ODD protocol](ODD/HealthSim_ODD.pdf). This document presents the *Overview, Design concepts and Details* (ODD) protocol of the model. 

### Code
In the folder [Code]{/Code} you can find the full source code of our model. The model is written in Java using the simulation software [Repast Simphony](https://repast.github.io/).
