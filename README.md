# HealthSim
Agent-based model of the health care systems - written in Java/Repast. 

This is the public repository for the agent-based model **HealthSim** developped at the Simulation Unit of the National Laboratory of Public Policy in Mexico City. **HealthSim** is a flexible multi-purpose agent-based model of the healthcare system. It is built around a number of core processes that are likely to matter in all health stystem. Furthermore, it is built with flexibility in mind, allowing interested researchers to adapt the model relatively easily to different contexts through parameters and input data. 


In this repository you will find the *full source code*, research articles and the Overview, Design concepts and Details (ODD) protocol of the model.
